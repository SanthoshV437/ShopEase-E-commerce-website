      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Know your audience.</strong>
          <p>Write down who your ideal customer is — age, location, interests, and the problems they want to solve. Every marketing decision should start from this customer profile.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Optimize product pages.</strong>
          <p>Use clear photos, benefits-focused descriptions, and strong calls-to-action. Make the price, shipping info, and return policy easy to find.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Use social proof.</strong>
          <p>Add customer reviews, testimonials, and real photos from buyers to build trust and increase conversions.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Start an email list.</strong>
          <p>Collect emails with a simple popup or discount offer. Send helpful content, product launches, and exclusive offers — email converts very well.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Post consistently on social media.</strong>
          <p>Pick 1–2 platforms where your customers hang out. Share product photos, behind-the-scenes, and short tips. Consistency beats perfection.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Run low-budget ads to test ideas.</strong>
          <p>Use small daily budgets to test headlines, creatives, and audiences. Learn what works before scaling spend.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Use search-friendly titles and descriptions.</strong>
          <p>Make titles descriptive and include keywords customers use when searching. This helps organic search and paid campaigns perform better.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Leverage partnerships.</strong>
          <p>Collaborate with micro-influencers or local businesses for shoutouts or giveaways — often low-cost and high-impact.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Measure the right metrics.</strong>
          <p>Track traffic sources, conversion rate, average order value, and customer acquisition cost. Focus on the metrics that impact revenue.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Iterate and document what works.</strong>
          <p>Keep simple notes about each campaign (what you changed and the result). Over time, you’ll build a playbook that grows your business reliably.</p>
